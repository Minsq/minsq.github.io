My first encounter with Jeju Island was at the tender age of 11, during a family tour. While the memories of that tour may be a bit hazy, two distinct flavors remain â€“ the sweet tang of orange chocolate and the comforting warmth of a steaming bowl of porridge enjoyed amidst the chilly island air. These lingering impressions always sparked a yearning to return to this enchanting island.

Fast forward to adulthood, and an unexpected opportunity arose: remote work. With the allure of Jeju Island ever-present, I seized the moment. Scoot offered incredibly affordable return flights for just $450 SGD (before baggage), and I booked them without a second thought.

Following a friend's recommendation, I chose to stay in Seogwipo. This proved to be an excellent decision, as Seogwipo is a charming coastal town that seamlessly blends tranquility and adventure. It provided the perfect base for my island explorations while offering a peaceful haven to retreat to after a day of work.
