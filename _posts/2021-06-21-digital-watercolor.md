It has been more than a year since COVID-19 hit and the situation has
been anything but optimistic. I cheered for a lockdown at the start, but the
continually cycle of lockdowns and reopenings only make things uncertain and difficult.

Have always been fascinated with art pieces that use watercolor, especially architectural landscapes.
I liked how they have come alive with those futuristic pink-purple-yellow colors.

I was very much inspired by this blog [depiction.com](https://www.depiction.com/) and one of their tutorials on Youtube explained how to color.
It was a good platform to start.
