### Background
It has been more than a year since COVID-19 hit and the situation has been anything but optimistic.
I cheered for a lockdown at the start, but the continually cycle of lockdowns and reopenings only make things uncertain and difficult.

Have always been fascinated with art pieces that use watercolor, especially architectural landscapes.
I liked how they have come alive with those futuristic pink-purple-yellow colors

### Inspiration and tools
I was very much inspired by this blog [depiction.com](https://www.depiction.com/) and one of their tutorials on Youtube explained how to color.
It was a good platform to learn and start.

During 10-day lockdown in the hotel, I had time on my hands.

I took out my ipad mini, downloaded [SketchBook](https://www.sketchbook.com/apps), which is free and tried my hands on this.

It was tedious but more fun than expected. I played around with the different pens, brushes, layers and got to work.

### This was my end result

I was really happy with it, going with the flow with the shading and colors. Although there were no pink-purple hues, I guess the peaceful blue-turquoise skies would make do for now.

I tried a similar technique using a picture taken during a horse riding experience in Turkey. I finally got my pinkish hues in, so I was happy with that :)

### Peace out
The above were all hand-drawn and colored.
I do wonder if there's a possibility to use code to automate the colouring with pink-purple-yellow hues.
That would be amazing hehe.
