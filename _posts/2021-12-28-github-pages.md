### How it started
It has been 4 years since graduation from college and I felt a little guilty for not spending time to pen down my portfolios :cry-laugh:.

I found out about Github pages from my edX course with CS50 web (by HarvardX) around late 2021.

##### Salient points:
- Github pages is free (YES!) but there are some limitations.
	- It only pushes up content from html files and does not host databases. This means that you cannot set up a database to pull info from it to dynamically update content on a webpage, but you get away with the complex stuff (e.g. security) related to web development with databases.
	- You can manage your content with static site generators like Jekyll (I used this) or Hugo to automate the task of coding individual HTML templates and serving them ahead of time.
- You can design it to be a very nice website.

### Quick notes on how to get started

There are many sites out there that details how to publish a blog on Github pages and Jekyll, so I would not spend too much time on this.

##### Some resources that may be helpful:
- [Comprehensive post on Jekyll + Github pages](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)
- [Github Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- [HTML5 free templates](https://html5up.net/) (optional)

On whether to use the free templates from Jekyll or HTML5, the Jekyll templates can be more straight forward in terms of setting up your blog, compared to the HTML5 templates where you would need to know how to change it to suit the Jekyll templating format. Notwithstanding that, I find using HTML5 templates a good way to learn how to use Jekyll. For info, I used the [Strata](https://html5up.net/strata) template from HTML5.

### Conclusion
I'm happy with being able to set up a [portfolio site](https://minsq.github.io/) to share my work.

Hope it helps and please reach out if you have any questions~~
