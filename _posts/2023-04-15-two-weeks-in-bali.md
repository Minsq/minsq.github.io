### Overview: Digital Nomad Life: Ubud Edition
Who would've thought I'd be trading my office cubicle for the lush rice paddies of Ubud? Two weeks of remote work in this Balinese paradise was an experience I won't forget!

### Payments
Let's talk about the practicalities first. While Ubud offers an idyllic setting, its payment system is a bit old-school. Cash is king here! Credit cards are accepted in some places, but often with a hefty 3% service charge. So, it's best to come prepared with more cash.

### Wifi Network
WiFi, on the other hand, can be a bit of a rollercoaster. While most cafes we went to offer it, consistency is a different story. I found myself relying heavily on my data plan which, thankfully, held up pretty well.

### Food
Ubud isn't just about stunning rice terraces and spiritual retreats; it's also a haven for foodies. Food places that has the word "warung", meaning roadside stalls (i.e. local options) offer delicious and most value for monies meals, averaging between SGD$4-7 per person with drinks.

- Warung Lamien

Many cafes feature cozy indoor seating areas, perfect for escaping the midday heat, with modern chic vibes. It's the ideal spot to enjoy a good book and catch up with friends. The cafe prices are steeper, costing about SGD$12-15 per person.

### Experiences
Now, the fun part! Remote working in Ubud was an absolute dream. The laid-back atmosphere, coupled with the stunning natural beauty, created the perfect environment for productivity and creativity. We had free breakfast offered at the guesthouse we stayed at, and afternoons were spent working at cafes, exploring hidden waterfalls or hiking trails. It was the ultimate work-life balance!

Let me tell you about some of the amazing experiences I had:
1. White Water Rafting: This was an adrenaline junkie's paradise! Navigating the rapids was exhilarating, and the lush greenery surrounding the river made it even more magical. It was the perfect way to cool off and have some fun.
2. Mount Batur Sunrise Trek: Hiking up Mount Batur was tough. We were picked up from our accoms at 2am, reached the starting point at about 3.30am and started the hike at about 4am. It was extremely steep, so you would have to catch your breathe from time to time. About 1 hour into the hike, the path narrows, and you would have to queue to go up this ragged path with many people. We reached the first view point after 2.5 hours and watched the sunrise from there. The pictures were worth every step. Watching the sunrise paint the sky in hues of pink and orange while overlooking the caldera was breathtaking. After sunrise, we continued to the next start point and started the descent through another exit.
3. Campuhan Ridge Walk: We attempted this on one of the mornings before starting work as it's near Ubud city. The walk was incredibly scenic, with stunning rice terraces on one side and lush jungle on the other. It was the perfect way to start the day.
4. Jatiluwih Rice Terraces: This was a photographer's dream! The terraced rice fields were endless, and the view was simply stunning. It was like stepping into a postcard. Good workout too!
5. Tegenungan Waterfall: A refreshing oasis amidst the heat. The waterfall was powerful and beautiful, and the surrounding area was lush and green. It was the perfect place to cool off after a day of exploring.

### Conclusion
Ubud truly exceeded my expectations. It's a place where you can immerse yourself in nature, indulge in delicious food, and experience the warmth of Balinese hospitality. From the thrill of white water rafting to the serenity of the Campuhan Ridge Walk, there's something for everyone.
